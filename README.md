## Standard ERC20 Token Contract

Enabling users to issue their own ERC20 tokens

## About the contract

To deploy the contract, a user can copy the code in the erc20token.sol
file to the [Remix Ethereum Org](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js)
, and deploy the contract over there. 

Alternatively, a user can write her/his own JavaScript file to compile and deploy the contract.
